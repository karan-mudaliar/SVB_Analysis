Proposal draft

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank is a complex issue that has attracted the attention of many analysts and researchers. The hypothesis is that a combination of economic, managerial, and regulatory factors may have played a role in the bank's downfall. The research question/goal is, "What are the key factors that contribute to a bank's failure, and how can these factors be identified and monitored to prevent future failures?".

We will be using the FFIEC for the institutional reports of Silicon Valley Bank, and its more successful competitors. Methods to download and use data. Methods to tidy/transform(computing key ratios) data. Data modelling to find correlations with target variables. Data visualization of these important variables for trend analysis and Graphical comparisons.

Using above trends and graphs to come to some conclusions. We can use some figures for prelim results for good indicators that could explain the failure. It is important to note that no single parameter can accurately predict a bank's risk of failure, and a comprehensive analysis of multiple indicators is necessary for a more accurate assessment.

We will create a pipeline for data extraction, transformation and loading from multiple sources online. Then we find correlations using statistics and make a reasonable conclusion. The complexity seems reasonable for the timeline we have been provided.
